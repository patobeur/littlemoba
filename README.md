## Project Overview

This project is a real-time multiplayer game where players can battle each other in rooms. It features a Node.js backend with an Express server for handling HTTP requests and a WebSocket server for real-time communication. The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript and uses the three.js library for 3D rendering of the game world. User data is stored in a SQLite database.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

-  **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: JavaScript runtime environment.
-  **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Web framework for Node.js, used for the HTTP server and API.
-  **[ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws)**: WebSocket library for real-time communication.
-  **[SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)**: For the user database.
-  **[bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)**: For hashing passwords.
-  **[express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)**: For managing user sessions.

### Frontend

-  **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ESM)**
-  **[three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: 3D graphics library for rendering the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or later recommended)
-  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patobeur/littlemoba.git
   cd littlemoba
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Run the following command in the root directory of the project to install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 8080 by default. You can access the application by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

The console will display messages indicating that the HTTP and WebSocket servers are running:

```
[HTTP] Serveur démarré sur http://0.0.0.0:8080
[WS] Serveur WebSocket prêt
Système de rooms activé
Connected to SQLite database.
Users table created or already exists.
```
